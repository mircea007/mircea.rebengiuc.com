          <p>I made <a href="https://bacplus.ro/">this</a> website in colaboration with my cousin, Tiberiu. In romania news outlets are <i>obsessed</i> with the exam at the end of the last school year: Bacalaureat, commonly called <b>BAC</b>. My cousing thought that he should make a website with exam statistics and give it to the media. He told me about it and I asked if I could work on it too. He did the statistics and I focused more on the web design. When the 2021 edition of the exam came along it ended up being a success. Over 12000 people saw the website and we were featured on 30 different media outlets.</p>

          <p><a href="http://cristian.francu.com">Cristian Francu</a> (my teacher) in 2021 held a few lessons about some very simple 3D graphics. We used SDL, a very simple graphics library and worked our way up. First we learned how to draw lines eficiently with Brezenham and then gradients, then we learned how to generate 3D shapes and render them. I ended up making <a href="/download/lit.zip" download>this program</a> in C. This program can render seven shapes (you can cicle through them using the arrow keys) and you cand rotate them to see what happens (Q, A, S, D, 0, 9). There is also an option to change the projection function by pressing P</p>

          <p>I have this website since 2021 when I bought the domain <a href="http://rebengiuc.com">rebengiuc.com</a>. My section, <a href="http://mircea.rebengiuc.com">mircea.rebengiuc.com</a> is where I keep my website. In september I started remodeling the site because I didn't update the website in a while and I thought that now I could do better. My cousin, Tiberiu, told me about <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">tailwind css</a> and it is amazing. Making something look good is't a chore anymore. It also has responsive classes so you will never need to make a media query ever again. Also btw did I mention that they have native dark mode support? Tailwind is awsome and you should check it out.</p>

          <p><a href="http://airborne01.herokuapp.com/">Airborne</a> is a multiplayer .io game i made during the 2019 summer vacation. I made it using Node.js and HTML canvas. Each player is a plane, you can shoot over players and your score increases evry time you kill someone. The game features: a chat, smoke particle effects, lag and bugs. There is also a documentation page <a href="http://airborne01.herokuapp.com/doc.html">here</a>. I also put some screenshots below for you to enjoy</p>
